          What began in the 80s as small professionally owned start-ups,
          offering registry services in the then largely manual driven industry,
          has over the last few decades, grown into what is Our Company today.
          Thus, when in 1999 Spectrum Corporate Services Ltd. (incorporated
          1987) and Intime Share Services Pvt. Ltd. (incorporated 1989), merged
          into a single entity, it built upon the promoters’ strong commitment
          towards consistent and quality offerings in the Corporate Registry
          space in India.

          Our Company has striven hard to achieve its current status as the
          leading Registrars in the IPO & Corporate Registry domain. This has
          been possible due to the single minded focus on the Registry business
          and providing value to its prestigious client companies. Our Company
          is synonymous with impeccable service level quality, delivered
          consistently in time, every time.

        <p class>
          Our Company’s main processing centre in Mumbai, the financial capital
          of India, is considered one of the best for its hybrid infrastructure,
          robust technology framework and best in class human resources.
          Knowledge, Technology, People and Infrastructure are thus the four
          strong pillars upon which the service model of Our Company is founded.

          All these positives were responsible for Link Market Services, a
          global registry player based out of Australia, acquiring Intime in
          2008 and set Our Company on the path of future growth and
          consolidation.
